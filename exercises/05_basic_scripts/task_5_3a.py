Task 5.3a

Copy and change the script from task 5.3 in such a way that, depending on
the selected mode, different questions were asked in the request for the VLAN number
or VLAN list:
* for access: 'Enter VLAN number:'
* for trunk: 'Enter the allowed VLANs:'

Restriction: All tasks must be done using the topics covered in this and previous chapters.
This task can be solved without using the if condition and for/while loops.
