Task 7.2b

Make a copy of the code from the task 7.2a.
Add this functionality: instead of printing to stdout,
the script should write the resulting lines to a file.

File names must be passed as arguments to the script:
  1. name of the source configuration file
  2. name of the destination configuration file

In this case, the lines that are contained in the ignore list and lines
that start with ! must be filtered.

Restriction: All tasks must be done using the topics covered in this and previous chapters.
