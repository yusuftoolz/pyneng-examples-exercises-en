the output below:

An example of creating an instance of a class:
In [5]: ip1 = IPAddress('10.1.1.1/24')

In [6]: str(ip1)
Out[6]: 'IP address 10.1.1.1/24'

In [7]: print(ip1)
IP address 10.1.1.1/24

In [8]: ip1
Out[8]: IPAddress('10.1.1.1/24')

In [9]: ip_list = []

In [10]: ip_list.append(ip1)

In [11]: ip_list
Out[11]: [IPAddress('10.1.1.1/24')]

In [12]: print(ip_list)
[IPAddress('10.1.1.1/24')]
