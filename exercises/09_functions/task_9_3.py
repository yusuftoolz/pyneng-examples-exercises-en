Task 9.3

Create a get_int_vlan_map function that handles the switch configuration
file and returns a tuple of two dictionaries:

* a dictionary of ports in access mode, where the keys are port numbers,
  and the access VLAN values (numbers):
{'FastEthernet0/12': 10,
 'FastEthernet0/14': 11,
 'FastEthernet0/16': 17}

* a dictionary of ports in trunk mode, where the keys are port numbers,
  and the values are the list of allowed VLANs (list of numbers):
{'FastEthernet0/1': [10, 20],
 'FastEthernet0/2': [11, 30],
 'FastEthernet0/4': [17]}

The function must have one parameter, config_filename, which expects as an argument
the name of the configuration file.

Check the operation of the function using the config_sw1.txt file.

Restriction: All tasks must be done using the topics covered in this and previous chapters.
