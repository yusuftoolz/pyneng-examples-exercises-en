Task 9.2a

Make a copy of the code from the task 9.2.

Change the function so that it returns a dictionary instead of a list of commands:
- keys: interface names, like 'FastEthernet0/1'
- values: the list of commands that you need execute on this interface

Check the operation of the function using the example of the trunk_config
dictionary and the trunk_mode_template template.

An example of a final dict (each string is written on a new line for readability):
{
    "FastEthernet0/1": [
        "switchport mode trunk",
        "switchport trunk native vlan 999",
        "switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30",
    ],
    "FastEthernet0/2": [
        "switchport mode trunk",
        "switchport trunk native vlan 999",
        "switchport trunk allowed vlan 11,30",
    ],
    "FastEthernet0/4": [
        "switchport mode trunk",
        "switchport trunk native vlan 999",
        "switchport trunk allowed vlan 17",
    ],
}

Restriction: All tasks must be done using the topics covered in this and previous chapters.
