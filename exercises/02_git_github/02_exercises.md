# Tasks

### Task 2.1

Create your repository based on repository template with tasks and examples. To do this, press "Use this template".

Created repository will be a copy of pyneng-examples-exercises-en repository, but is not tied to it. It's better to perform tasks in prepared files in exercises directory as tests for tasks depend on created directory structure.
