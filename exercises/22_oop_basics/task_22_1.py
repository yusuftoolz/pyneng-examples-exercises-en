Task 22.1

Create a Topology class that represents the topology of the network.

When creating an instance of a class, a dictionary that describes the topology
is passed as an argument. The dictionary may contain "duplicate" connections.
"Duplicate" connections are a situation when there are two connections
in the dictionary:
    ("R1", "Eth0/0"): ("SW1", "Eth0/1")
    ("SW1", "Eth0/1"): ("R1", "Eth0/0")

The task is to leave only one of these links in the final dictionary,
no matter which one.

In each instance, a topology instance variable must be created, which contains
the topology dictionary, but already without "duplicates". The topology instance
variable should contain a dict without "duplicates" immediately after instance
creation.

An example of creating an instance of a class:
In [2]: top = Topology(topology_example)

After that, the topology variable should be available:

In [3]: top.topology
Out[3]:
{('R1', 'Eth0/0'): ('SW1', 'Eth0/1'),
 ('R2', 'Eth0/0'): ('SW1', 'Eth0/2'),
 ('R2', 'Eth0/1'): ('SW2', 'Eth0/11'),
 ('R3', 'Eth0/0'): ('SW1', 'Eth0/3'),
 ('R3', 'Eth0/1'): ('R4', 'Eth0/0'),
 ('R3', 'Eth0/2'): ('R5', 'Eth0/0')}
