Task 17.2

In this task you need:
* take the contents of several files with the output of the sh version command
* parse command output using regular expressions and get device information
* write this information to a file in CSV format

To complete the task, you need to create two functions.

parse_sh_version function:
* expects the output of the sh version command as an argument in single string (not a filename)
* processes output using regular expressions
* returns a tuple of three elements:
 * ios - "12.4(5)T"
 * image - "flash:c2800-advipservicesk9-mz.124-5.T.bin"
 * uptime - "5 days, 3 hours, 3 minutes"

The write_inventory_to_csv function must have two parameters:
* data_filenames - expects a list of filenames as an argument with
  the output of sh version
* csv_filename - expects as an argument the name of a file (for example,
  routers_inventory.csv) to which information will be written in CSV format

write_inventory_to_csv function writes the contents to a file, in CSV format and returns nothing.

The write_inventory_to_csv function should do the following:
* process information from each file with sh version output:
  sh_version_r1.txt, sh_version_r2.txt, sh_version_r3.txt
* using the parse_sh_version function, ios, image, uptime information
  should be obtained from each output
* from the file name you need to get the hostname
* after that all information should be written to a CSV file

The routers_inventory.csv file should have the following columns (in this order):
* hostname, ios, image, uptime

The code below has created a list of files using the glob module.
You can uncomment the print(sh_version_files) line to see the content of the list.

In addition, a list of headers has been created, which should be written to CSV.
"""

import glob

sh_version_files = glob.glob("sh_vers*")
# print(sh_version_files)

headers = ["hostname", "ios", "image", "uptime"]
