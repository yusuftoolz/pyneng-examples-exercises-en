# Updated tasks and tests. (July 13 2021)

Changes in tests and tasks:

* All tests have been changed so that to the left of == assert is the correct version of the output, and to the right is the output from the task.
  Thus, pytest-clarity shows in green the correct option, in red what is received from the task
* Updated pyneng utility and pytest.ini config files - removed pytest option due to pytest-clarity update
* updated tasks, most of them small changes, clarification of the wording
* removed task: 15.2a
* Updated pyneng_common_functions.py file in exercises directory
